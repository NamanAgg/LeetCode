//****************130. Surrounded Regions
// Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
// A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

// Example 1:
// Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
// Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
// Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
// Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
// Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

// Example 2:
// Input: board = [["X"]]
// Output: [["X"]]

// Constraints:
// m == board.length
// n == board[i].length
// 1 <= m, n <= 200
// board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
